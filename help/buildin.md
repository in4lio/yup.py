 | **Functions and constants imported from Python `string` module**
`($digits)` | The string `'0123456789'`.
`($hexdigits)` | The string `'0123456789abcdefABCDEF'`.
`($letters)` | The concatenation of the strings `lowercase` and `uppercase` described below.
`($lowercase)` | A string containing all the characters that are considered lowercase letters. On most systems this is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
`($octdigits)` | The string `'01234567'`.
`($uppercase)` | A string containing all the characters that are considered uppercase letters. On most systems this is the string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`.
`($whitespace)` | A string containing all characters that are considered whitespace. On most systems this includes the characters space, tab, linefeed, return, formfeed, and vertical tab.
`($atof s)` | Convert a string to a floating point number.
`($atoi s [base])` | Convert string s to an integer in the given base. The base defaults to 10. If it is 0, a default base is chosen depending on the leading characters of the string (after stripping the sign): `0x` or `0X` means 16, `0` means 8, anything else means 10. If base is 16, a leading `0x` or `0X` is always accepted.
`($atol s [base])` | Convert string s to a long integer in the given base. The base argument has the same meaning as for `atoi`. A trailing `l` or `L` is not allowed, except if the base is 0.
`($capitalize word)` | Capitalize the first character of the argument.
`($capwords s)` | Split the argument into words using `split`, capitalize each word using `capitalize`, and join the capitalized words using `join`. Note that this replaces runs of whitespace characters by a single space, and removes leading and trailing whitespace.
`($expandtabs s tabsize)` | Expand tabs in a string, i.e. replace them by one or more spaces, depending on the current column and the given tab size. The column number is reset to zero after each newline occurring in the string. This doesn't understand other non-printing characters or escape sequences.
`($find s sub [start [end]])` | Return the lowest index in s where the substring sub is found such that sub is wholly contained in `s[start:end]`. Return -1 on failure. Defaults for start and end and interpretation of negative values is the same as for slices.
`($rfind s sub [start [end]])` | Like `find` but find the highest index.
`($index s sub [start [end]])` | Like `find` but raise ValueError when the substring is not found.
`($rindex s sub [start [end]])` | Like `rfind` but raise ValueError when the substring is not found.
`($count s sub [start [end]])` | Return the number of (non-overlapping) occurrences of substring sub in string `s[start:end]`. Defaults for start and end and interpretation of negative values is the same as for slices.
`($lower s)` | Convert letters to lower case.
`($maketrans from to)` | Return a translation table suitable for passing to `translate`, that will map each character in _from_ into the character at the same position in _to_; _from_ and _to_ must have the same length.
`($split s [sep [maxsplit]])` | Return a list of the words of the string s. If the optional second argument sep is absent or None, the words are separated by arbitrary strings of whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, return, formfeed). If the second argument sep is present and not None, it specifies a string to be used as the word separator. The returned list will then have one more items than the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the separator in the string. The optional third argument maxsplit defaults to 0. If it is nonzero, at most maxsplit number of splits occur, and the remainder of the string is returned as the final element of the list.
`($join words [sep])` | Concatenate a list or tuple of words with intervening occurrences of sep. The default value for sep is a single space character.
`($lstrip s)` | Remove leading whitespace from the string s.
`($rstrip s)` | Remove trailing whitespace from the string s.
`($strip s)` | Remove leading and trailing whitespace from the string s.
`($swapcase s)` | Convert lower case letters to upper case and vice versa.
`($translate s table [deletechars])` | Delete all characters from s that are in deletechars (if present), and then translate the characters using table, which must be a 256-character string giving the translation for each character value, indexed by its ordinal.
`($upper s)` | Convert letters to upper case.
`($ljust s width)`<br>`($rjust s width)`<br>`($center s width)` | These functions respectively left-justify, right-justify and center a string in a field of given width. They return a string that is at least width characters wide, created by padding the string s with spaces until the given width on the right, left or both sides. The string is never truncated.
`($zfill s width)` | Pad a numeric string on the left with zero digits until the given width is reached. Strings starting with a sign are handled correctly.
`($replace str old new [maxsplit])` | Return a copy of string str with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If the optional argument maxsplit is given, the first maxsplit occurrences are replaced.
