## **yupp** and Sublime Text

This folder contains a "navigational" plugin and configuration files for Sublime Text editor.
The plugin allows to switch between the generated text and its origin.

Unfortunately, the plugin hasn't been released as a package yet, just copy everything into your Sublime Text folder.

If the new theme is not applied, please remove the cache with the old theme<br>
`Data/Packages/Color Scheme - Default/Monokai.tmTheme.cache`.
