    ___ WHAT IS IT? ______________________________

    yupp is a text preprocessor which implements the macro language with
    Lisp-like Polish notation syntax in fully parenthesized prefix form.
    yupp is intended to transform C programs before they are compiled.
    It can also be useful for more general purposes.
    An embedding of macro constructions into the source code occurs by
    the use of "application form" e.g. ($e).

    ___ SYNTAX ___________________________________

    Core syntactic forms of the language are a list, an application and a lambda.

    list ::= '(' { form }0... ')'

    (0.2 "string" atom)

    application ::= '($' function { argument }0... ')'

    ($add 2 2)

    lambda ::= { '\' name { ':' default } '.' }1... form

    \p.($add p 1)

    All core forms can be included into each other. Only an application
    form can be embeded into the source code directly.

    Any functions from "string", "operator" and "math" modules of Python
    standard library can be used in preprocessor expressions.

    Following examples show basic syntax constructions of the language.
