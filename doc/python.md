## Macros in Python _(still in the writing process)_

[**yupp**](https://github.com/in4lio/yupp/) is a text macro processor designed
to compensate for the lack of metaprogramming facilities in the C language.

First of all, you need to install [yupp package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yupp/):

    pip install yupp
