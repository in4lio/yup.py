## Macros in Python _(still in the writing process)_

[**yupp**](https://github.com/in4lio/yupp/) is a lexical macro processor designed
primarily to compensate for the lack of metaprogramming facilities in the C language.
**yupp** allows us to program transformation of the source code, before compiling,
in the functional style.

First of all, you need to install [yupp package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yupp/):

    pip install yupp

Start your source file with:

    # coding: yupp
